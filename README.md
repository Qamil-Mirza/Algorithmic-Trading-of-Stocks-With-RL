# Algorithmic-Trading-of-Stocks-With-RL

## Project Description

This project focuses on developing an algorithmic trading system for stocks using Reinforcement Learning (RL). The system aims to make profitable trading decisions by learning from historical stock data and adapting to market changes.

## Features

- **Reinforcement Learning Algorithms**: Implements various RL algorithms such as Q-learning, Deep Q-Network (DQN), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Utilizes historical stock data to train the RL models.
- **Backtesting**: Provides a backtesting framework to evaluate the performance of the trading strategies.
- **Visualization**: Includes tools for visualizing stock prices, trading actions, and portfolio performance.
- **Customization**: Allows customization of trading strategies and RL parameters to suit different trading goals and risk appetites.
